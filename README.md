# Song Recommendations

## The problem:

The NPDB, the National Practitioner Data Bank, has public data avaible [here](https://www.npdb.hrsa.gov/resources/publicData.jsp) on malpratice payments. The objective of this project is to classify 
payment that are under, over, or exactly six-figure payments. 

## Solution(s)

-  ### K-neighbors
    *  Able to get a nice amount of recommendations
    *  Unable to find out base of what due to PCA

-  ### Random Forest Classifier
   * Hard to get recommendation with a small user data set
   * We can see how it learns
   
## What's next
   - Testing via users and getting feedback
   - Get a hardware to that was hyper parametrize
   - Using two userâ€™s input of like songs, can we recommend a list that both users will regardless of size.e higher the outcome (1-9).
