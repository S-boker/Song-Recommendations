# Song Recommendations

## The problem:

   - Given over 1 million songs and a user’s input of like songs, can we recommend new songs that are not on this list?

   - Can we also do it quickly, incase we need to train and produce new data as soon as possible?

## Solution(s)

-  ### K-neighbors
    *  Able to get a nice amount of recommendations
    *  Unable to find out base of what due to PCA

-  ### Random Forest Classifier
   * Hard to get recommendation with a small user data set
   * We can see how it learns
   
## What's next
   - Testing via users and getting feedback
   - Get a hardware to that was hyper parametrize
   - Using two user’s input of like songs, can we recommend a list that both users will regardless of size.e higher the outcome (1-9).
